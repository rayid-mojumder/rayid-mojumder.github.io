  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Soft electronics, known for their bendable, stretchable, and flexible properties, are revolutionizing fields such as biomedical sensing, consumer electronics, and robotics. A primary challenge in this domain is achieving low power consumption, often hampered by the limitations of the conventional von Neumann architecture. In response, the development of soft artificial synapses (SASs) has gained substantial attention. These synapses seek to replicate the signal transmission properties of biological synapses, offering an innovative solution to this challenge. This review explores the materials and device architectures integral to SAS fabrication, emphasizing flexibility and stability under mechanical deformation. Various architectures, including floating-gate dielectric, ferroelectric-gate dielectric, and electrolyte-gate dielectric, are analyzed for effective weight control in SASs. The utilization of organic and low-dimensional materials is highlighted, showcasing their plasticity and energy-efficient operation. Furthermore, the paper investigates the integration of functionality into SASs, particularly focusing on devices that autonomously sense external stimuli. Functionalized SASs, capable of recognizing optical, mechanical, chemical, olfactory, and auditory cues, demonstrate promising applications in computing and sensing. A detailed examination of photo-functionalized, tactile-functionalized, and chemoreception-functionalized SASs reveals their potential in image recognition, tactile sensing, and chemosensory applications, respectively. This study highlights that SASs and functionalized SAS devices hold transformative potential for bioelectronics and sensing for soft-robotics applications; however, further research is necessary to address scalability, long-time stability, and utilizing functionalized SASs for prosthetics and in\&nbsp;vivo applications through clinical adoption. By providing a comprehensive overview, this paper contributes to the understanding of SASs, bridging research gaps and paving the way toward transformative developments in soft electronics, biomimicking and biointegrated synapse devices, and integrated systems.},

  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2409.00538},
  abstract = {A Proportional- Integral- Derivative (PID) controller is required to bring a system back to the stable operating region as soon as possible following a disturbance or discrepancy. For successful operation of the PID controller, it is necessary to design the controller parameters in a manner that will render low optimization complexity, less memory for operation, fast convergence, and should be able to operate dynamically. Recent investigations have postulated many different meta-heuristic algorithms for efficient tuning of PID controller under various system milieus. However, researchers have seldom compared their custom made objective functions with previous investigations while proposing new algorithmic methods. This paper focuses on a detailed study on the research progress, deficiency, accomplishment and future scopes of recently proposed heuristic algorithms to designing and tuning the PID controller parameters for an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system. Objective functions, including ITSE, ITAE, IAE, ISE, and ZLG, are considered to enumerate a measurable outcome of the algorithms. Considering a slight variation in the sytem gain parameters of the algorithms, the observed PID gain with ITSE results in 0.81918 - 1.9499 for K\_p, 0.24366 - 1.4608 for K\_i, and 0.31840 - 0.9683 for K\_d. Whereas with ITAE the values are 0.24420 - 1.2771, 0.14230 - 0.8471, and 0.04270 - 0.4775, respectively. The time domain and frequency domain characteristics also changes significantly with each objective function. Our outlined comparison will be a guideline for investigating any newer algorithms in the field.},

  abstract={Halide perovskites are promising photovoltaic, solar cell, and semiconductor materials. Density-functional theory (DFT) models address compressive and tensile biaxial strain effects on APbCl3, where A = (K, Rb, and Cs). This research shows how A-cation impacts bandgap energy and band structure. The direct bandgap for KPbCl3, RbPbCl3, and CsPbCl3 is found 1.612, 1.756, and 2.046 eV, respectively; increases from A = K to Cs. When spinâ€“orbital coupling (SOC) is introduced, bandgaps in KPbCl3, RbPbCl3, and CsPbCl3 perovskites are reduced to 0.356, 0.512, and 0.773 eV, respectively. More tensile strain widens the bandgap; compressive strain narrows it. Without SOC, the bandgaps of KPbCl3, RbPbCl3, and CsPbCl3 were tuned from 0.486 to 2.213 eV, 0.778 to 2.289 eV, and 1.168 to 2.432 eV, respectively. When the compressive strain is increased, the dielectric constant of APbCl3 decreases (redshift) and increases (blueshift) as the tensile strain is increased. Strain improves APbCl3 perovskite's optical performance.}

  abstract={This work focuses on the design of modern power system controllers for automatic voltage regulators (AVR) and the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms to correctly classify the stability of the IEEE 14 bus system. The LQG controller performs the best time domain characteristics compared to PID and LQG, while the sensor and amplifier gain is changed in a dynamic passion. After that, the IEEE 14 bus system is modeled, and contingency scenarios are simulated in the System Modelica Dymola environment. Application of the Monte Carlo principle with modified Poissons probability distribution principle is reviewed from the literature that reduces the total contingency from 1000k to 20k. The damping ratio of the contingency is then extracted, pre-processed, and fed to ML algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, random forests, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor. A neural network (NN) of one, two, three, five, seven, and ten hidden layers with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% data size is considered to observe and compare the prediction time, accuracy, precision, and recall value. At lower data size, 25%, in the neural network with two-hidden layers and a single hidden layer, the accuracy becomes 95.70% and 97.38%, respectively. Increasing the hidden layer of NN beyond a second does not increase the overall score and takes a much longer prediction time; thus could be discarded for similar analysis. Moreover, when five, seven, and ten hidden layers are used, the F1 score reduces. However, in practical scenarios, where the data set contains more features and a variety of classes, higher data size is required for NN for proper training. This research will provide more insight into the damping ratio-based system stability prediction with traditional ML algorithms and neural networks.}

  abstract={This research unravels the photocatalytic properties of a 2D ZnO/SiC van der Waals hetero-bilayer for potential water-splitting applications by first-principles calculations. Four unique stacking patterns are considered in studying the electronic and optical properties in the presence and absence of biaxial external strain. For pattern-I and II, large negative binding energy and positive phonon frequencies are observed, denoting chemical and mechanical stabilities. Under the HSE-06 pseudo potential, the calculated bandgap value for pattern-I and II reaches 2.86 eV and 2.74 eV, respectively. 2D ZnO/SiC shows a high absorption coefficient (âˆ¼105 cmâˆ’1). The absorption peak under biaxial strain could reach âˆ¼3.5 times the peak observed under unstrained conditions. Under strain, a shift from compressive to tensile biaxial strain (âˆ’6% to 6%) results in a bandgap decrease from 3.18 eV to 2.52 eV and 3.09 eV to 2.43 eV, for pattern-I and II, respectively. The observed strain-driven kinetic overpotential for 2D ZnO/SiC pattern-I and II easily engenders photocatalytic redox reactions. The excellent mechanical durability and strain-driven large kinetic overpotential suggest 2D ZnO/SiC heterobilayers as a prospective material for water-splitting H2-fuel production.}

  abstract={Strain engineering has widely been recognized as a highly sensitive and effective way to modulate the physical properties of materials. Here, we thoroughly investigate the effects of biaxial strain-driven optoelectronic properties and thermodynamic stability of BX (Xdouble bondP and As) monolayers under a density functional framework. The electronic bandgap at the K-point of these materials increases with tensile (0 to +10%) strain and decreases in the presence of compressive (âˆ’10% to 0) strain. The phonon modes indicate that monolayer BP becomes thermodynamically unstable with larger than 4% compressive strain, and BAs loses stability at 4% compressive strain. However, both structures can show quite stable nature for up to + 8% tensile strain. In the presence of compressive strain, the longitudinal optical (LO) and transverse optical (TO) phonon modes become softening in nature. In contrast, it displays hardening behavior with the tensile strain in these materials. Also, superior light absorption near the infrared and visible light spectrum is feasible by the BP and BAs monolayer when the biaxial strain is incorporated. These results elucidate a promising way to manipulate the optical and electronic properties of monolayer BP and BAs via strain engineering and eventually make these materials promising for futuristic spintronics, electronics, and optoelectronic device applications.}

  abstract={Lead-free inorganic metal halide perovskites CsGeCl3 have recently gained prominent research interest in solar technology due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and mechanical stability. Here, the density functional theory is considered to investigate the biaxial strain-driven (from âˆ’6% to +6%) structural configuration, mechanical stability, and optoelectronic properties of non-toxic CsGeCl3 metal halide. Optical properties such as absorption coefficient, dielectric functions, and electron loss function show that due to the biaxial strain (compressive and tensile), this material has a high absorption capacity of photons in the visible and ultraviolet regions, and that's why it is very much suitable to apply in the solar cells and other optoelectronic energy devices. The electronic band structure shows that CsGeCl3 is a semiconductor material with a direct bandgap of 0.768 eV at the R-point. Moreover, we observed a semiconductor-to-metallic transition of the bandgap of CsGeCl3 in the presence of the compressive strain. The findings of the mechanical properties of the CsGeCl3 perovskites demonstrate that Ge could be a suitable replacement for Pb in the traditional Pb-based perovskite structures. Especially in the strain portion of âˆ’2% to +2%, the investigated metal halide perovskite structure, Pb being replaced by Ge, shows mechanical ductility, absorption of visible and UV radiation, prominent absorption peaks, tunable bandgap value of 0.123 to 0.896 eV and thus, is very much suitable to be considered for solar photovoltaic applications.}

In this paper, the influence of biaxial compressive and tensile strains (âˆ’6% to +6%) on the optoelectronic properties of APbI3 perovskites is thoroughly investigated using density functional theory, based on first-principles calculations. Additionally, this study identifies the function of the A-cation in the optoelectronic properties of APbI3. We find that the biaxial strain in APbI3 can significantly increase its absorbance, both in the visible and ultraviolet light energy range. Interestingly, the absorption coefficient, dielectric function, and electron loss function are tuned into visible ranges when a compressive strain is applied, whereas these functions move into the ultraviolet region for tensile strain. Furthermore, the electronic band structure shows that the APbI3 compounds are all semiconductors with direct bandgap ranges of 0.92â€“1.09 eV and 1.9 eV at the R-point. The value of the bandgap decreases to 0.17, 0.25, and 0.32 eV for KPbI3, RbPbI3, and CsPbI3, respectively, when the spinâ€“orbit coupling effect is considered. Moreover, the bandgap of APbI3 shows a decreasing trend and tends towards the metallic condition when compressive strain is applied. In addition, when tensile strain is increased, the bandgap of APbI3 exhibits an increasing trend. Therefore, based on the optical and electronic properties, applying a biaxial strain should make APbI3 compounds suitable for optoelectronic device applications.}

However, no comprehensive paper has been compiled regarding the of operation of V2G and types, current ratings and types of EV in sells market, policies relevant to V2G and business model, and the implementation difficulties and current procedures used to cope with problems. This work better represents the current challenges and prospects in V2G implementation worldwide and highlights the research gap across the V2G domain. The research starts with the opportunities of V2G and required policies and business models adopted in recent years, followed by an overview of the V2G technology; then, the challenges associated with V2G on the power grid and vehicle batteries; and finally, their possible solutions. This investigation highlighted a few significant challenges, which involve a lack of a concrete V2G business model, lack of stakeholders and government incentives, the excessive burden on EV batteries during V2G, the deficiency of proper bidirectional battery charger units and standards and test beds, the injection of harmonics voltage and current to the power grid, and the possibility of uneconomical and unscheduled V2G practices. Recent research and international agency reports are revised to provide possible solutions to these bottlenecks and, in places, the requirements for additional research. The promise of V2G could be colossal, but the scheme first requires tremendous collaboration, funding, and technology maturation.}

  abstract={Global energy demand is continuously increasing where the pollution and harmful greenhouse gases that originated from the burning of fossil fuels are alarming. Various policies, targets, and strategies are being set to the carbon footprint. Renewable energy penetration into the utility grid, as well as bidirectional power flow between generation and end-users, are also potentials. A microgrid energy system can help distribute energy from intermittent renewable generation centres to load centres more effectively. The microgrid system efficiently utilises electricity from renewable sources, such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. The potential renewable transition opens up a lot of possibilities for microgrids that are both grid-connected and islanded. Digital technology, specialised energy measurement devices, a fast and efficient communication system, energy storage systems, and dynamic control techniques are all used. The renewable-based microgrid system faces numerous techno-economical vulnerabilities due to the volatile and environmental dependencies of renewable energy. The complex power converter stages, lack of strict regulatory rules, grid operations and management, communications between the centralised and decentralised controllers come into play while investigating the microgrid system. This paper focuses on the prospects of renewable-based microgrid system implementation in Bangladesh. The major challenges and solutions to those challenges are described with all the current breakthroughs across the world to solve some core issues regarding microgrid planning, controlling, maintenance, resilience, and economics.}

  abstract={Electric vehicles (EVs) in Malaysia are gaining more attention and interest from the public. However, the electric vehicleâ€™s exposure, awareness, and sales are still low compared to other countries. In this review, the challenges associated with implementing the electric vehicle culture in Malaysia are thoroughly reviewed, including the obstacles that the Malaysian government, policymakers, EV manufacturers, and EV users face in terms of EV cost, travel demand, charging station availability, impact on the power grid, and battery capacity. Then, all the identified challenges have been addressed by considering the user behavior, travel demand, socio-economical culture of Malaysia, current policies taken by the government of Malaysia, and the psychological outlook of Malaysians towards EV adoption. Moreover, potential suggestions have been proposed that the government of Malaysia may adopt during policy planning and when seeking to provide incentives to the users. Finally, a concrete conclusion has been drawn by disseminating the vision about the future of EVs in Malaysia. The proposed review of the technologies, challenges, prospects, and potential solutions associated with EV adoption in Malaysia can provide a base for proper strategic policy and help policymakers frame strategies to achieve the targets. This review could help achieve sustainable EV transport, and the successful implementation of Malaysian National Automotive Plan 2020, with the goal of adopting next-generation green vehicles.}

  abstract={Here, we provide a systematic assessment of biaxial strain effects on the electronic, phonon, and optical properties of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) XTe2 (X = Mo and W) using density functional theory calculations. We observed a large direct bandgap of 1.163 eV and 0.974 eV for MoTe2 and WTe2, which reduced to 1.042 eV and 0.824 eV in the spinâ€“orbit coupling ambient. The XTe2 structures show a tunable bandgap with the variation of the applied biaxial strains. Due to the breaking of inversion symmetry, a large spin-valley coupling emerged at the valance band edges for both MoTe2 and WTe2 monolayers under applied biaxial strain. The phonon properties with different biaxial strains reveal that monolayer MoTe2 is more stable than the WTe2 structure. The calculated optical properties demonstrate that the dielectric constant and absorption coefficient of MoTe2 and WTe2 move to higher photon frequencies when the compressive strain is increased. On the other hand, with the increase in tensile strain, a red-shift behavior is found in the calculated optical properties, indicating the suitability of the XTe2 monolayer for different infrared and visible light optical applications.}

  abstract={Of late, inorganic perovskite material, especially the lead-free CsGeBr3, has gained considerable interest in the green photovoltaic industry due to its outstanding optoelectronic, thermal, and elastic properties. This work systematically investigated the strain-driven optical, electronic, and mechanical properties of CsGeBr3 through the first-principles density functional theory. The unstrained planar CsGeBr3 compound demonstrates a direct bandgap of 0.686 at its R-point. However, incorporating external biaxial tensile (compressive) strain can be tuned the bandgap lowering (increasing) to this perovskite. Moreover, due to the increase of tensile (compressive) strain, a red-shift (blue-shift) behavior of the absorption-coefficient and dielectric function is found in the photon energy spectrum. Strain-induced mechanical properties also reveal that CsGeBr3 perovskites are mechanically stable and highly malleable material and can be made suitable for photovoltaic applications. The strain-dependent optoelectronic and mechanical behaviors of CsGeBr3 explored here would benefit its future applications in optoelectronics and photovoltaic cells design.}

  abstract={In this research work, the 2D structure of the germanene layer is compounded with 2D group-III phosphides: AlP and GaP. The planar structure of AlP and low-buckled GaP have been taken to form the bilayer patterns. In each case, three stacking patterns are considered, and their relaxed interlayer distance and binding energy have been reported. The binding energy being around in the range between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals interactions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and these two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude range of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer distance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain. Although their normal bandgap, which significantly changes with SOC, is an indirect one, whilst tunning the interlayer distance band gap jumps from unsymmetrical point to symmetrical Dirac cones and becomes direct on K points. The charge carrier mostly concentrates on the p-orbitals of the germanene in the conduction regions; thus, the electrical properties of germanene will be retained, and the carrier will provide a much faster device response property. The absence of the phosphides influence makes them the intended substrate for growing the germanene layer on top of that. Again, due to the bandgap at Dirac cones being opened and jumps between the Dirac cones and band gap changes with SOC tropological insulator can be formed, and Quantum Spin Hall effect may exist.}

  abstract={In recent days, two-dimensional (2D) silicene, a close neighbor to graphene and germanene, has garnered massive research attention for its promising electronic properties and structural stabilities. However, the inherent zero bandgaps is a major limitation of the silicene-based materials to incorporate them into the manufacturing of nanoelectronic devices. As a step to solving this problem, in this research, we presented a first principle investigation of group IV honeycomb silicene monolayer stacked above 2D gallium phosphide (h-Si/GaP) monolayer. The research is carried out sequentially in order to examine the tunable structural and electrical aspects of the h-Si/GaP heterobilayer structure. The proposed 2D h-Si/GaP exhibits a direct 356 meV bandgap at the K-point. This bandgap is tailorable between 0 meV to 536 meV by modifying the interval between the monolayer of silicene and Gallium phosphide. The study into the charge density states and the charge density difference reveals that the 2D-GaP monolayer acts as a very good substrate, making the charge carriers move across the silicene layer only with carrier mobility of 1.13 Ã— 10 5 cm 2 V âˆ’1 s âˆ’1 . These behavioral phenomena make the proposed novel h-Si/GaP heterobilayer a promising material for high speedy, tunable, and structurally stable nanoelectronic and spintronic devices.}

  abstract={This research demonstrates the time-domain performance characteristics of proportional-integral-derivative (PID), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) controllers when the gain parameters and time constants of an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system change. We tuned the amplifier and sensor block gains and scrutinized the change in the stability. Also, we investigated the system response while the time constant of the amplifier, exciter, generator, and sensor blocks are set to their maximum permissible limit. We determined the eigenvalues of the system and observed that the location of close loop poles is very much susceptive to time constant variations. The LQG controller provides a comparatively faster and stable response than LQR and PID. When the gain parameters and time constants of the static AVR system are varied, the PID performance decreases significantly, but LQR and LQG can track the change rapidly. This analysis indicates that the impact of plant parameters on the controller response will be crucial while implementing the dynamic power system with distributed generators and interconnected grids.}

  abstract={Due to its unique optical and electrical features, two-dimensional (2D) SiC has recently fascinated tremendous attention as an active material for optoelectronic devices. Here we numerically design a high-performance multi-quantum well (MQW) blue light-emitting diode (LED) using 2D-SiC. Our study suggests that for a rectangular potential well of 2D-SiC, having 4H-SiC as a quantum barrier and GaN as the electron blocking layer is an efficient electron confining structure, and almost all the recombination is radiative, and injection efficiency is high. Due to this effect, the resultant internal quantum efficiency is also higher. The extraction efficiency is found to be around 22% for flat design, which can further be increased. The most effective improvement has been founded in the decrease in efficiency droops at high injection current. The internal quantum efficiency is constantly above 98% up to 150 mA. The CIE color coordinate refers to the supreme blue color and paves that the considered LED is a good candidate for LED display manufacturing.}

  abstract={The high electronegativity between the atoms of two-dimensional (2D) group-III nitrides makes them attractive to demonstrating a strong out-of-plane piezo-electricity effect. Energy harvesting devices can be predicted by cultivating such salient piezoelectric features. This work explores the tribo-piezoelectric properties of 2D-indium nitride (InN) as a promising candidate in nanogenerator applications by means of first-principles calculations. In-plane interlayer sliding between two InN monolayers leads to a noticeable rise of vertical piezoelectricity. The vertical resistance between the InN bilayer renders tribological energy by the sliding effect. During the vertical sliding, a shear strength of 6.6â€“9.7 GPa is observed between the monolayers. The structure can be used as a tribo-piezoelectric transducer to extract force and stress from the generated out-of-plane tribo-piezoelectric energy. The Aâ€“A stacking of the bilayer InN elucidates the highest out-of-plane piezoelectricity. Any decrease in the interlayer distance between the monolayers improves the out-of-plane polarization and thus, increases the inductive voltage generation. Vertical compression of bilayer InN produces an inductive voltage in the range of 0.146â€“0.196 V. Utilizing such a phenomenon, an InN-based bilayer compression-sliding nanogenerator is proposed, which can tune the generated tribo-piezoelectric energy by compressing the interlayer distance between the InN monolayers. The considered model can render a maximum output power density ofâ€‰~â€‰73 mWcmâˆ’2 upon vertical sliding.}

  abstract={The photocatalytic characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) GeC-based van der Waals heterobilayers (vdW-HBL) are systematically investigated to determine the amount of hydrogen (H2) fuel generated by water splitting. We propose several vdW-HBL structures consisting of 2D-GeC and 2D-SiC with exceptional and tunable optoelectronic properties. The structures exhibit a negative interlayer binding energy and non-negative phonon frequencies, showing that the structures are dynamically stable. The electronic properties of the HBLs depend on the stacking configuration, where the HBLs exhibit direct bandgap values of 1.978 eV, 2.278 eV, and 2.686 eV. The measured absorption coefficients for the HBLs are overâ€‰~â€‰105 cmâˆ’1, surpassing the prevalent conversion efficiency of optoelectronic materials. In the absence of external strain, the absorption coefficient for the HBLs reaches around 1â€‰Ã—â€‰106 cmâˆ’1. With applied strain, absorption peaks are increased toâ€‰~â€‰3.5 times greater in value than the unstrained HBLs. Furthermore, the HBLs exhibit dynamically controllable bandgaps via the application of biaxial strain. A decrease in the bandgap occurs for both the HBLs when applied biaxial strain changes from the compressive to tensile strain. Forâ€‰+â€‰4% tensile strain, the structure I become unsuitable for photocatalytic water splitting. However, in the biaxial strain range of âˆ’ 6% toâ€‰+â€‰6%, both structure II and structure III have a sufficiently higher kinetic potential for demonstrating photocatalytic water-splitting activity in the region of UV to the visible in the light spectrum. These promising properties obtained for the GeC/SiC vdW heterobilayers suggest an application of the structures could boost H2 fuel production via water splitting.}

  abstract={Van der Waals heterobilayer, consisting of different two-dimensional (2D) materials, has recently drawn substantial research attention. We present a detailed investigation of the structure and electronic properties of germanene and 2D silicon carbide (Ge/2D-SiC) van der Waals heterobilayer by means of first-principles calculations under the framework of density functional theory. Three different stacking patterns are predicted for this Ge/2D-SiC heterostructure. All the representative structures offer a direct bandgap of approximately 80â€“100â€¯meV. The breaking of the sub-lattice symmetry as well as the transfer of charges are perceived as the pivotal effects that open the bandgap for each structure. The compressive bi-axial strain is applied for the further tune of the bandgap, resulting in an alter in the bandgap from 85 to 118â€¯meV. Upon varying the interlayer distance between germanene and 2D-SiC the bandgap can further be tuned. The distribution of space charges of the conduction and valence bands and projected density of states represent that germanene plays the main role in forming the heterobilayers electronic properties, thus suggesting the ability of 2D-SiC as a stable substrate. These outcomes expose that Ge/2D-SiC heterostructure would be an incredible resource for imminent Ge-based high-performance nanoelectronic devices such as quantum computing spintronic devices and nanoscale energy storage devices.}

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrated the geometric configurations and electronic properties of germanene/2D-AlP vdWHs. We considered four high symmetric patterns that show a bandgap opening in the heterostructures of 200 meVâ€“460 meV. The incorporation of spin-orbital coupling reduces the bandgap by 20 meVâ€“90 meV. Both direct and indirect bandgaps were found from these high symmetric patterns, depending on the structural patterns. The charge density distribution and the partial density of states confirmed that germanene was the property builder of the heterostructure, in which 2D-AlP could be a decent substrate. The heterostructure bandgap can be widely tuned in the range 0 meVâ€“500 meV by changing the interlayer separation between the two monolayers. The application of strain and external electric fields also significantly tailored the electronic structures of the heterostructures. Intriguingly, an exceptionally high carrier mobility of more than 1.5 Ã— 105 cm2 Vâˆ’1 sâˆ’1 was observed, which outperforms compared to other studies on germanene heterostructures. All these promising properties make the germanene/2D-AlP heterostructure a viable candidate for FETs, strain sensors, nanoelectronics, and spintronic devices.}
